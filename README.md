Overview
This project consists of several tasks related to array manipulation in JavaScript. Each task focuses on implementing different functions to process arrays and generate formatted outputs.

Tasks 1: processArray Function
This function takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled.

Task 2: formatArrayStrings Function
This function takes two arrays as arguments: an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by “processArray”. It modifies each string based on its corresponding number capitalizes the entire string if the number is even and converts the string to lowercase if the number is odd.

Task 3: createUserProfiles Function
This function takes an array of names and an array of modified names from Task 2. It returns an array of objects, each containing “originalName”, “modifiedName” and “id” (auto-incremented starting from 1).
